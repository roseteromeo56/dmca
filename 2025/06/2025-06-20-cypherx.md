Note: Because the reported network that contained the allegedly infringing content was larger than one hundred (100) repositories, and the submitter alleged that all or most of the forks were infringing to the same extent as the parent repository, GitHub processed the takedown notice against the entire network of 2,099 repositories, inclusive of the parent repository.  
  
---  
  
Evidence of Infringement:  
1. Direct File Copies  
- `lib/PluginManager.js`  
- [private] original commit `5aad612` (https://github.com/Dark-Xploit/CypherX/commit/5aad6129d6256a954b4f594a5b8d45ecd6cbba1b), deleted Mar 10  
- Their copy: `KANGO-XMD/lib/PluginManager.js` (https://github.com/OfficialKango/KANGO-XMD/blob/main/lib/PluginManager.js)  
  
- `lib/emojis.js`  
- [private] original commit `32a0730` (https://github.com/Dark-Xploit/CypherX/commit/32a073086199833ec257fafa5ae64ed2845a60a0), deleted Mar 10  
- Their copy: `KANGO-XMD/lib/emojis.js` (https://github.com/OfficialKango/KANGO-XMD/blob/main/lib/emojis.js)  
  
2. Copied `src/` Directory contents  
- [private] original `src/` folder deleted in commit `86abd19` (https://github.com/Dark-Xploit/CypherX/commit/86abd19deed5a2f0267445878aed238134e9e0ae) on Mar 31  
- Their current `src/` folder KANGO-XMD/src (https://github.com/OfficialKango/KANGO-XMD/tree/main/src)  
The entire src/ directory in the infringing repository exhibits substantial similarity in structure and files(e.g., `Core/`, `Plugins/`) to [private] original src/ directory, which was also deleted from [private] repository:  
  
src/ directory — Deleted in commit: 86abd19  
  
The same applies to the lib/ directory in structure and contents.  
  
• Additional Infringement: In addition to the files and directory structure previously mentioned, the infringing repository also contains unauthorized copies of [private] index.js (which [private] later renamed to cypher.js) and system.js files—while now deleted from [private] repository, they were part of [private] original work.  
  
These files are particularly significant because [private] had taken the proactive step of obfuscating them within [private] original CypherX repository to prevent unauthorized access and use.  
  
The repository at https://github.com/OfficialKango/KANGO-XMD contains rebranded versions of these same files that have been re-obfuscated. This demonstrates a clear act of copying [private] original, albeit obfuscated, code and then further modifying it without [private] permission. [private] original commits would also show the existence and subsequent updates and deletions of these obfuscated files.  
  
While obfuscation makes direct line-by-line comparison different, the functionality, structure, and behavior are identical.  
  
Additional Infringing Files  
As per your request for specific infringing files, here are the primary ones (though the issue applies to the full repository):  
  
lib/PluginManager.js  
  
lib/emojis.js  
  
src/Core/ (mirrors [private] deleted directory)  
  
src/Plugins/ (copied structure and command patterns)  
  
system.js (rebranded, re-obfuscated)  
  
index.js / cypher.js (copied base file)  
  
Any file under /lib and /src reflects copied architecture, names, and logic  
  
  
Therefore, the presence of [private] obfuscated code, rebranded and re-obfuscated, within the https://github.com/OfficialKango/KANGO-XMD repository further confirms that the entire repository contains unauthorized copies and modifications of [private] copyrighted work.  
  
[private] original work had no license, meaning all rights are reserved under copyright law.  
  
While I provided specific examples of infringing files and directories to illustrate the nature of the infringement, these examples are indicative of a broader pattern of copying. Therefore, I reiterate that the entire repository at https://github.com/OfficialKango/KANGO-XMD contains unauthorized copies of [private] copyrighted work with minor cosmetic changes.  
  
Regarding the forks, based on the representative number of forks I have reviewed, I believe that all or most of the forks are infringing to the same extent as the parent repository.  
  
Please proceed with disabling the entire fork network associated with the parent repository:  
https://github.com/OfficialKango/KANGO-XMD  
  
I have a good faith belief that the use of [private] copyrighted materials within the entire https://github.com/OfficialKango/KANGO-XMD repository is not authorized by me, the copyright holder, nor by any agent or the law.  
I have also taken fair use into consideration.  
  
I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.
