[private] the [private] of Monokai Pro, a commercial software theme plugin for code editors.  
  
**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed.**  
  
Monokai Pro is a commercial theme plugin for code editors. Users need a license key to remove occasional popup messages. Upon payment, an automatic email is sent with the license key information, which the user can enter so that the popups are removed.  
  
The infringing repository automatically generates those licenses, circumventing technological restrictions placed in the software.  
  
**If the original work referenced above is available online, please provide a URL.**  
  
The commercial website is available at https://monokai.pro  
  
**We ask that a DMCA takedown notice list every specific file in the repository that is infringing, unless the entire contents of the repository are infringing on your copyright. Please clearly state that the entire repository is infringing, OR provide the specific files within the repository you would like removed.**  
  
**Based on the above, I confirm that:**  
  
The entire repository is infringing  
  
**Identify the full repository URL that is infringing:**  
  
https://github.com/maximilionus/monokai_pro_keygen  
  
**Do you claim to have any technological measures in place to control access to your copyrighted content? Please see our <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice#complaints-about-anti-circumvention-technology">Complaints about Anti-Circumvention Technology</a> if you are unsure.**  
  
Yes  
  
**What technological measures do you have in place and how do they effectively control access to your copyrighted material?**  
  
A valid license key is needed to remove the popups. A license is automatically generated upon payment and sent via email to the user.  
  
**How is the accused project designed to circumvent your technological protection measures?**  
  
It generates valid license keys for Monokai Pro without my consent.  
  
**If you are reporting an allegedly infringing fork, please note that each fork is a distinct repository and <i>must be identified separately</i>. Please read more about <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/dmca-takedown-policy#b-what-about-forks-or-whats-a-fork">forks.</a> As forks may often contain different material than in the parent repository, if you believe any of the repositories or files in the forks are infringing, please list each fork URL below:**
