**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

I am the [private] and [private] of the project described below. [private] developed the code, assets, and documentation entirely [private], and [private] have not granted permission for its reproduction, distribution, or modification by any third party. The specific part of plagiarism that is publicly visible is the "Landing Page".

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed.**

The original copyrighted work is a video game project developed by [private], titled "BerryLands." It includes custom source code, featuring the same soft pink aesthetic, documentation, and related materials. The infringing repository has copied substantial portions of [private] project, including the same code structure, comments, and textual content, without proper authorization or attribution. I can only attach a repository where only the webpage [private] created several months ago is identifiable, as the rest of the project (the video game and its code) is located in a private repository. The public repository's webpage is virtually identical to the one [private] have for [private] project, with only some text and photos modified, but the rest of the code and information are [private] property.

**If the original work referenced above is available online, please provide a URL.**
