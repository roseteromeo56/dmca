Dear Github [private] team,   
  
  
I would like to hereby file a DMCA notice on

(hereafter Violations)  
I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.  
I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law.  
I have taken fair use into consideration.  
I have read and understand GitHub's Guide to Submitting a DMCA Takedown Notice  
  
  
Full Legal Name: [private]

Signed: /[private]/  
ACTION  
Attached, please find a contract between the user who posted the Github material and [private]. In the contract, we agreed that:  
1. The code is owned by the company;  
2. The code shall not be made public  
3. The code is confidential, and that this confidentiality lasts indefinitely;  
4. We will not build or support any code or project that competes with the code;  
5. We will not reuse code or ideas from the project in any competing project.   
  
  
The Violations are in direct contradiction to the executed contract, and are uploaded unlawfully (Attachment 1). As a result, I respectfully request that you remove this from your site.

MISLEADING BEHAVIOR AND FRAUDULENT THREAT OF ACTION  
User BlazerHM claims that the license is his and his alone:  
  
1. [private]  
  
2. [private]  
  
This is untrue and misleading. User BlazerHM is purposefully, willfully, and recklessly misleading Github users that this is his product, that he owns the product, and that he created the product. This is clear fraudulent behavior.   
Attached, please see screenshots from April, 2025 of me publicly describing this idea and seeking collaborators (Attachment 2). On the same date, I spoke with another collaborator on this project (Attachment 3).  
  
[private]  
  
[private]  
  
Later, [private] directly messaged BlazerHM to work together on the code.  As evidenced by the executed contract (Attachment 1), dated 04/06/25, BlazerHM (real name [private]) knew that (1) the code is not his property, (2) agreed that the code is confidential and shall not be shared, and (3) agreed to not compete against the project.   
  
[private]  
  
Moreover, please see screenshots, attached, from April and May demonstrating [private] advertising, promoting, and discussing the NewStudio project. Throughout these conversations, promotions, and advertisements, [private] demonstrate agency that this is [private] idea, brainchild, and most importantly, [private] property.

More evidence that this is [private] property includes:  
* 4/4/25: receipt that [private] paid for the domain.  
  
[private]  
  
* 5/5/25: receipt that [private] paid for a security bounty. The bounty was paid because BlazerHM was leaking information on a proprietary project.   
  
[private]  
  
By posting the code publicly, he willfully and recklessly violated the contract. Consequently, it is clear that he does not (1) own the code and (2) have the right to post the code on Github or anywhere else.   
REQUEST FOR ACTION  
  
  
Violations be DMCA’d and removed. The code is confidential as agreed upon by executed contract and may not be shared, be made public, or revealed. This is not BlazerHM’s property and the only recourse is fully deleting the Violations.   
Moreover, I respectfully request that:  
  
* BlazerHM be sanctioned for negligently misleading Github users.  
  
  
  
  
Thank you for your time and attention to this matter.
