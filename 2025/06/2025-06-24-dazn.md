Subject: DMCA Notice - Copyright Infringement on DAZN Content  
  
Dear Copyright Team,  
  
I am writing this letter on behalf of Dazn Limited, which is part of the Dazn group of companies (“DAZN”). DAZN is an over-the-top Subscription video streaming service. The service is dedicated to sports, offering live and on-demand streaming of events from various properties Worldwide (our Territories).    
  
DAZN is the exclusive licensee of copyright in the audio-visual production of various live sporting content and events. It is also the creator of and thereby the owner of copyright in the original content created for DAZN (DAZN live linear channels) that have been infringed upon and hosted on your platform, pursuant to the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA), 17 U.S.C. Section 512.  
    
I have a good faith belief that the website(s)/fork hosted by your service are infringing upon the exclusive rights owned by DAZN, specifically the rights protected by the Copyright Act, in violation of its provisions.     
  
The below forks are engaging in copyright piracy by offering unauthorized streams of digital content without the consent of the DAZN. It is also gathering a user base that is involved in illegal activities, such as copyright infringement using GitHub, leading to irreparable financial damages and loss. Please act expeditiously to remove or disable access to the infringing material as listed below.  
   
The unauthorized and infringing material can be found at the following URLs: (Links to be removed)
