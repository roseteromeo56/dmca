I am the [private] [private] and [private] rights holder of the Kerbal Space Program mod "Galaxies Unbound". [private] developed the mod, including many of its custom models, textures, and configurations. The project was published under the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0) license, which does not permit redistribution or the creation of derivative works without explicit permission. [private] did not authorize the reupload or modification of this content, and [private] have not granted any third party rights to redistribute or alter the project in any form. Therefore, I am fully authorized to request this takedown.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed.**

The original copyrighted work is a Kerbal Space Program (KSP) mod titled “Galaxies Unbound: A Stellar Odyssey”, which [private] created and published at the following repository:

Original repository URL:  
[private]

The mod consists of custom-designed star systems, planets, moons, and supporting files that expand the base game with scientifically-inspired celestial bodies and environments. It includes:

Original texture maps (diffuse, normal, and height maps) for planets and moons

Hand-crafted 3D models and visual assets for planetary detail and immersion

Configuration files for mod frameworks such as Kopernicus, EVE, and Scatterer

Custom system design and layout, including planetary names, orbits, and gameplay structure

UI, biome, and science definitions tailored to the original mod’s concept and lore

Visual branding and promotional content used in association with the mod

All content was published under the CC BY-NC-ND 4.0 license, which prohibits redistribution and derivative works without explicit permission. [private] later removed this repository voluntarily due to copyright concerns regarding some bundled assets. [private] did not grant anyone permission to reuse or republish any part of the project.

The infringing repository replicates many of these assets either directly or in modified form, violating the original license and my copyright.

**If the original work referenced above is available online, please provide a URL.**

**We ask that a DMCA takedown notice list every specific file in the repository that is infringing, unless the entire contents of the repository are infringing on your copyright. Please clearly state that the entire repository is infringing, OR provide the specific files within the repository you would like removed.**

**Based on the above, I confirm that:**

Specific files within the repository are infringing

**Do you claim to have any technological measures in place to control access to your copyrighted content? Please see our <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice#complaints-about-anti-circumvention-technology">Complaints about Anti-Circumvention Technology</a> if you are unsure.**

Yes

**What technological measures do you have in place and how do they effectively control access to your copyrighted material?**

At the time the original mod was publicly available, I hosted it under the [private] [private] [private] and later removed it to prevent unauthorized use and redistribution. Since then, [private] have not made the mod publicly available and have deliberately restricted access through the following technological and procedural controls:

The original [private] was [private], removing public access to the files.

No reuploads or mirrors are authorized by [private], and [private] have refused all requests to redistribute the content.

[private] now only share files privately and by request, when applicable, using platforms with explicit access control (e.g., Google Drive with restricted links).

The license (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0) was clearly stated in the repository, and redistribution is legally restricted.

These measures are intended to prevent unauthorized distribution, maintain control over derivative works, and minimize further risk to myself, as some content included third-party elements [private] no longer distribute.

**How is the accused project designed to circumvent your technological protection measures?**

The accused project—hosted at https://github.com/KochieBR/GalaxiesUnbound-Reupload—circumvents [private] technological protection measures by:

Reuploading the entire mod or significant portions of it after [private] took down the original repository to prevent further distribution.

Bypassing access restrictions [private] put in place by distributing the files publicly on GitHub, despite [private] explicit refusal to grant redistribution rights.

Ignoring the license terms (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0), which prohibit redistribution and derivative works, by modifying and updating the content to keep it active and relevant without authorization.

Undermining [private] controlled-access system by making previously restricted content freely available, despite [private] only sharing it on request under limited, private conditions.

These actions effectively nullify the control [private] implemented by removing the mod and restricting access to it, placing [private] at renewed legal and reputational risk, which [private] took specific steps to avoid.

**If you are reporting an allegedly infringing fork, please note that each fork is a distinct repository and <i>must be identified separately</i>. Please read more about <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/dmca-takedown-policy#b-what-about-forks-or-whats-a-fork">forks.</a> As forks may often contain different material than in the parent repository, if you believe any of the repositories or files in the forks are infringing, please list each fork URL below:**

https://github.com/KochieBR/GalaxiesUnbound-Reupload

**Is the work licensed under an open source license?**

No

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement?**

Other Change

**Describe the change.**

The best solution would be the complete removal of the infringing repository (https://github.com/KochieBR/GalaxiesUnbound-Reupload) and any of its forks or mirrors that contain the unauthorized content. This includes any files, assets, or configurations derived from or directly copied from [private] original mod, "Galaxies Unbound: A Stellar Odyssey."

Additionally, [private] ask that the user not be permitted to reupload or distribute the content again, as they have previously ignored direct requests and warnings. This step is necessary to protect [private] rights under the CC BY-NC-ND 4.0 license and to prevent continued exposure to legal risk resulting from unauthorized distribution.

**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it.**

I do not have the alleged infringer’s personal contact information. The only identifier available is their GitHub username: KochieBR.

**I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law.**

**I have taken <a href="https://www.lumendatabase.org/topics/22">fair use</a> into consideration.**

**I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.**
