**Are you submitting a revised DMCA notice after GitHub Trust & Safety requested you make changes to your original notice?**

No

**Does your claim involve content on GitHub or npm.js?**

GitHub

**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

I am [private] at Google. Google is the developer of Play automatic protection, which is a group of technological protection measures (TPMs) that Play app developers can enable to help protect the apps and games they distribute on the Play Store against unauthorized redistribution and piracy.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed.**

This is not a copyright infringement claim. It is an anti-circumvention claim.

**If the original work referenced above is available online, please provide a URL.**

The description of Play automatic protection can be found at https://developer.android.com/google/play/integrity#automatic-protection.

**We ask that a DMCA takedown notice list every specific file in the repository that is infringing, unless the entire contents of the repository are infringing on your copyright. Please clearly state that the entire repository is infringing, OR provide the specific files within the repository you would like removed.**

**Based on the above, I confirm that:**

The entire repository is infringing

**Identify the full repository URL that is infringing:**

https://github.com/void-eth/pairip-protection-remover

**Do you claim to have any technological measures in place to control access to your copyrighted content? Please see our <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice#complaints-about-anti-circumvention-technology">Complaints about Anti-Circumvention Technology</a> if you are unsure.**

Yes

**What technological measures do you have in place and how do they effectively control access to your copyrighted material?**

Play automatic protection consists of installer checks and anti-tamper protection for apps distributed on Google Play. Installer checks occur at runtime when a user opens an app to verify that the copy of the app on the user's device is not from an unknown distribution channel. Anti-tamper protection, when combined with installer checks, prevents attackers from bypassing the Play developer's distribution or monetization preferences through unauthorized modification, repackaging, redistribution, and piracy. If the checks fail, the user is prompted to get the app on Google Play or the app will not run.

**How is the accused project designed to circumvent your technological protection measures?**

The repository contains analysis and information about circumvention of automatic protection. The project provides both the required tooling (actual code in the repo that can circumvent the protection technology) and step-by-step technical instructions (via two [private] video tutorials and instructions in the repo’s readMe file) that can be followed to circumvent the protection technology.

**If you are reporting an allegedly infringing fork, please note that each fork is a distinct repository and <i>must be identified separately</i>. Please read more about <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/dmca-takedown-policy#b-what-about-forks-or-whats-a-fork">forks.</a> As forks may often contain different material than in the parent repository, if you believe any of the repositories or files in the forks are infringing, please list each fork URL below:**
