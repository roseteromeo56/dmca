**What technological measures do you have in place and how do they effectively control access to your copyrighted material?**

The source code was stored in a [private] accessible only to authorized team members of DISBOT TECHNOLOGIES LLP. Access required login credentials and was restricted to specific users within the company. The code was never intended to be made public or distributed outside of this controlled environment. No one was authorized to publish or share the code publicly on GitHub or any other platform.

An authorized team member who had access to the [private] and its contents intentionally made the source code public on GitHub without the consent or authorization of DISBOT TECHNOLOGIES LLP. By publishing the code to a public repository, they bypassed the access restrictions that were in place, making the proprietary content available to anyone without authorization.
