Yes, I am the copyright holder.

**Are you submitting a revised DMCA notice after GitHub Trust & Safety requested you make changes to your original notice?**

No

**Does your claim involve content on GitHub or npm.js?**

GitHub

**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

I am the [private] and [private] of “AuditFi” — a blockchain auditing project published to GitHub.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed.**

The project is licensed under the GNU Affero General Public License v3.0 (AGPLv3) and includes full commit history, documentation, and code authored entirely by [private]. This license explicitly requires attribution, license preservation, full source disclosure, and that derivative works be licensed under AGPLv3.

An individual using the GitHub account 0xkid-root has violated all of these terms. Without [private] permission or attribution, this person has:  
- Cloned [private] repositories,  
- Removed [private] name, license, and commit history,  
- Renamed the project “ProofChain,”  
- And submitted the copied work to multiple hackathons under different names.  

This is not an isolated case — the user has published the same stolen project several times across different repositories.

**If the original work referenced above is available online, please provide a URL.**

**We ask that a DMCA takedown notice list every specific file in the repository that is infringing, unless the entire contents of the repository are infringing on your copyright. Please clearly state that the entire repository is infringing, OR provide the specific files within the repository you would like removed.**

**Based on the above, I confirm that:**

The entire repository is infringing

**Identify the full repository URL that is infringing:**

https://github.com/0xkid-root/proofchain-rbtc  
https://github.com/0xkid-root/proofchain-pharos  
https://github.com/0xkid-root/ProofChain  

**Do you claim to have any technological measures in place to control access to your copyrighted content? Please see our <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice#complaints-about-anti-circumvention-technology">Complaints about Anti-Circumvention Technology</a> if you are unsure.**

No

**If you are reporting an allegedly infringing fork, please note that each fork is a distinct repository and <i>must be identified separately</i>. Please read more about <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/dmca-takedown-policy#b-what-about-forks-or-whats-a-fork">forks.</a> As forks may often contain different material than in the parent repository, if you believe any of the repositories or files in the forks are infringing, please list each fork URL below:**

**Is the work licensed under an open source license?**

Yes

**Which license?**

gnu-affero-general-public-license-v3.0

**How do you believe the license is being violated?**

The infringing user has:  
- Removed the AGPL license file and replaced it with no license or an altered one,  
- Removed attribution and commit history,  
- Claimed sole authorship,  
- Rebranded the project as “ProofChain” without listing it as a fork or derivative,  
- Failed to disclose the full modified source code, and  
- Re-uploaded it under multiple new repositories, violating the AGPL’s requirement to preserve license terms and share source under the same license.  

**What changes can be made to bring the project into compliance with the license? For example, adding attribution, adding a license, making the repository private.**

- Restore original license and copyright information,  
- Add clear attribution to [private] name and repositories,  
- Publicly disclose all modifications and source code,  
- Re-license the project under AGPLv3,  
- OR remove the infringing repositories entirely.  

**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it.**

Name: GitHub user "0xkid-root"  
GitHub Profile: https://github.com/0xkid-root

**I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law.**

**I have taken <a href="https://www.lumendatabase.org/topics/22">fair use</a> into consideration.**

**I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.**
