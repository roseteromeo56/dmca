Do you claim to have any technological measures in place to control access to your copyrighted content?  
Yes  
  
  
What technological measures do you have in place and how do they effectively control access to your copyrighted material?  
Our HTML5 games are only allowed to run on whitelisted domains. On our backends we take care of domain-whitelisting and other integrity checks. Due to the nature of HTML5 games i.e. client-side code, it’s easy to rehost and run it elsewhere. Experiments with code-mangling, site-locking and obfuscation have thus far only hurt legitimate players, whilst for game-rippers it remained trivial to circumvent.  
  
  
How is the accused project designed to circumvent your technological protection measures?  
This is a clone of our HTML5 code. Downloaded and rehosted on GitHub.  
  
  
Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately. As forks may often contain different material than in the parent repository, if you believe any of the repositories or files in the forks are infringing, please list each fork below:  
We haven't found any forks
