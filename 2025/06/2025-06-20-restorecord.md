Please see our <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice#complaints-about-anti-circumvention-technology">Complaints about Anti-Circumvention Technology</a> if you are unsure.**

Yes

**What technological measures do you have in place and how do they effectively control access to your copyrighted material?**

RestoreCord implements:  
- API authentication system with token validation  
- Rate limiting and anti-automation measures  
- Client-side integrity verification

These measures control access by ensuring only authorized users can access the service's functionality through legitimate channels.

**How is the accused project designed to circumvent your technological protection measures?**

The repositories contain code specifically designed to:  
- Forge authentication tokens to bypass API security  
- Evade rate limits and automation detection  
- Disable client-side integrity checks

The primary purpose of these repositories is to circumvent RestoreCord's protection measures, as evidenced by names like "RestoreCord-Bypass" and "bypass_restorecord.py".
