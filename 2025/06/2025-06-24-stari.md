Stari Sportech Ltd. registration no. 516357134 commissioned, funded, and authored the entire “Stari Pro” code-base between 2021–2024 through its engineering team and subcontractors working under work-for-hire agreements that expressly assign all intellectual-property rights to Stari.

[private] hold a written corporate authorization to act on the company’s behalf in all copyright matters, including sending DMCA notices. No licence to copy, publish, or distribute this code was ever granted to the current repository owner ([private]), Wiply was our external developer. On 10 Mar 2025 they unilaterally terminated the service contract yet kept exclusive control of the repository https://github.com/wiply-team/stari-client

Despite a work-for-hire clause assigning all IP to Stari Sportech Ltd., Wiply now refuses to transfer the repo and is demanding “US $2,000 per day” or they will delete it entirely, which would destroy our product.  
This repository therefore contains our proprietary source code being held and distributed without authorisation, and we respectfully request takedown action under the DMCA.
