Hello GitHub Support,

[private] have a separate GitHub account with the username wacknox, which is linked to the email [private]. Unfortunately, [private] no longer have access to that [private] account and am unable to recover the GitHub password due to the limitations of [private]'s account recovery system.

As a result, [private] am unable to log in to GitHub under that account, and I would like to request the removal of one or more repositories [private] had uploaded under the wacknox account.

Could you please advise on how [private] can verify ownership or proceed with this request?

Thank you for your time and assistance.

Best regards,  
[private]
