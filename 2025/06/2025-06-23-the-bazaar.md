I have read and understand GitHub's Guide to Filing a DMCA Notice.

This is a notice of copyright infringement. 

I swear, under penalty of perjury, that I am authorized by the copyright holder for the allegedly infringed upon material to submit this notice. The copyright holder is AVY Entertainment, Inc. and [private], [private] of the video game development studio Tempo, which develops and publishes the online video game, The Bazaar. https://playthebazaar.com/

Link to the infringing material: https://github.com/stonehenge-collective/bazaar-buddy-client/tree/main, by users [private], [private], and [private].

The infringing material is software which grants information to the player in the form of an 'overlay,' which reads the text of items, entities, and creatures in the game's events and automatically searches for further information on outside databases. 

The mode of operation for the software, by its own description, requires constant copying and reproduction of materials subject to copyright. The software scans the screen for images and text within the game, feeding that information into an "AI" that then searches databases for further information on the scanned sections. This constitutes "use" of the material in question.

Despite the claims to the contrary on the Bazaar Buddy page, faster access to information conveys a competitive advantage to players, allowing the player to make optimal choices in less time, to complete more games more quickly, to acquire higher rank, and to obtain more prizes. Use of such third-party software in conjunction with The Bazaar is a violation of the EULA for the game, Section 3, License. It appears that the creator of this overlay is aware of this restriction, as, in the "frequently asked questions" section of the page, in lieu of an assurance to users that the software is not restricted, they assure the user that their software will go undetected.

The page also includes the creator's plan to collect information on player choices and correlate them with outcomes, then sell that information via a subscription model, in the following FAQ section.

It is Tempo's policy to prohibit any third party software which runs in conjunction with, and which is reliant upon, our intellectual property, particularly those which convey a competitive advantage to players. Such software harms the competitive environment within an inherently competitive game, risking harm to the studio itself and to the copyright holders.   The only remedy is to request its removal.

I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law. I have taken fair use into consideration.  I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.
